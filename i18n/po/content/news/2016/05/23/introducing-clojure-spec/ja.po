"Clojure is a dynamic language, and thus far we have relied on documentation or external libraries to explain the use "
"and behavior of functions and libraries. But documentation is difficult to produce, is frequently not maintained, "
"cannot be automatically checked and varies greatly in quality. Specs are expressive and precise. Including **spec** "
"in Clojure creates a lingua franca with which we can state how our programs work and how to use them."

"A key advantage of specifications over documentation is the leverage they provide. In particular, specs can be "
"utilized by programs in ways that docs cannot. Defining specs takes effort, and **spec** aims to maximize the return "
"you get from making that effort. **spec** gives you tools for leveraging specs in documentation, validation, error "
"reporting, destructuring, instrumentation, test-data generation and generative testing."

"Error messages from macros are a perennial challenge for new (and experienced) users of Clojure. Specs can be used to "
"conform data in macros instead of using a custom parser. And Clojure's macro expansion will automatically use specs, "
"when present, to explain errors to users. This should result in a greatly improved experience for users when errors "
"occur."

"Clojure has always been about simplifying the development of robust software. In all languages, dynamic or not, tests "
"are essential to quality - too many critical properties are not captured by common type systems. **spec** has been "
"designed from the ground up to directly support generative testing via https://github.com/clojure/test.check[test."

"Taken together, I think the features of **spec** demonstrate the ongoing advantages of a powerful dynamic language "
