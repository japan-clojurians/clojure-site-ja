"<<xref/../../../../../../reference/transducers#,Transducers>> are composable algorithmic transformations. They are "
"independent from the context of their input and output sources and specify only the essence of the transformation in "
"terms of an individual element. Because transducers are decoupled from input or output sources, they can be used in "
"many different processes - collections, streams, channels, observables, etc. Transducers compose directly, without "
"awareness of input or creation of intermediate aggregates."

"Many existing sequence functions now have a new arity (one fewer argument than before). This arity will return a "

"Reader conditionals are a new reader form that is only allowed in portable cljc files. A reader conditional "
"expression is similar to a cond in that it specifies alternating platform identifiers and expressions. Each platform "
"is checked in turn until a match is found and the expression is read. All expressions not selected are read but "
"skipped. A final :default fallthrough can be provided. If no expressions are matched, the reader conditional will "
"read nothing. The reader conditional splicing form takes a sequential expression and splices the result into the "
"surrounding code."
