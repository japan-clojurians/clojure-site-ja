"Clojure has been very fortunate to receive infrastructure support from https://www.atlassian.com[Atlassian] (for JIRA "
"and Confluence) and https://www.contegix.com/[Contegix] (for hosting) for many years. The Confluence and JIRA "
"instances were not kept up to date, and have grown increasingly hard to maintain. Recently, we decided to shut down "
"Confluence (content was either moved to https://clojure.org[clojure.org] or https://archive.clojure.org/design-wiki/"
"display/design/Home.html[archived]) and we are now preparing to migrate from our old JIRA instance into a new cloud-"
"hosted instance. Many thanks to Atlassian again for supporting our efforts in this."

"Due to the large number of users, it is not feasible for us to move everyone, and we've decided to migrate all users "
"that have edited tickets in the past (changed a description, added a patch, etc) - this will move user names and "
"emails, not passwords. When the import happens, email invites will go out for users in the new system based on the "
"email address in the old system. Initially these users will not have access to projects."

"Users that created or commented on tickets in the past (but did not edit) will not automatically be migrated. We are "
"planning to leverage JIRA Service Desk to create a new path for language users to file tickets without needing an "
"account. These incoming tickets can be triaged and turned into JIRA tickets as needed. We are also looking at a new "
"process to obtain a contributor account and gain access to the system for commenting or other work. Stay tuned for "
"more on that."
