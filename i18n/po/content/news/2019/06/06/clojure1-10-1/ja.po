"Recent builds of Java 8 (u202), 11 (11.0.2), 12, and 13 included some changes that drastically affect optimization "
"performance of calls from static initializers to static fields. Clojure provides support for loading code on startup "
"from a user.clj file and this occurred in the static initializer of the Clojure runtime (RT) class and was thus "
"affected."

"This issue may eventually be resolved in Java, but in Clojure we have modified runtime initialization to avoid "
