"Two years ago, in a http://clojure.com/blog/2012/05/15/anatomy-of-reducer.html[blog post describing how reducers "
"work], I described the reducing function transformers on which they were based, and provided explicit examples like "
"`mapping`, `filtering` and `mapcatting`. Because the reducers library intends to deliver an API with the same 'shape' "
"as existing sequence function APIs, these transformers were never exposed a la carte, instead being encapsulated by "
"the macrology of reducers."

"In working recently on providing algorithmic combinators for core.async, I became more and more convinced of the "
"superiority of reducing function transformers over channel->channel functions for algorithmic transformation. In "
"fact, I think they are a better way to do many things for which we normally create bespoke replicas of map, filter "
"etc."
