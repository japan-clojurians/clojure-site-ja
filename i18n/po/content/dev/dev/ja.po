"that are well-written with good patches can move quickly through the cycle at the appropriate time."

"Clojure is an open-ended project with no fixed release schedule. Major releases typically occur about once per year. "
"While there are usually a few focused areas of work in a major release, it is common for those to change during the "
"development of the release in response to either feedback or changing external needs. Because of this, a roadmap is "
"typically not declared at the beginning of a release. Ongoing development is visible during alpha releases, often "
"phased over multiple dev releases. The <<xref/../../community/devchangelog#,Dev Changelog>> chronicles these changes "
"during the release cycle."

"Additionally, the core team may be doing work in dependent projects or tools, rather than the language itself, such "
