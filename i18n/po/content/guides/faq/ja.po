"Because of its focus on immutable data, there is generally not a high value placed on data encapsulation. Because "
"data is immutable, there is no need to worry about someone else modifying a value. Likewise, because Clojure data is "
"designed to be manipulated directly, there is significant value in providing direct access to data, rather than "
"wrapping it in APIs."

"All Clojure vars are globally available so again there is not much in the way of encapsulation of functions within "
"namespaces. However, the ability to mark vars private (either using `defn-` for functions or `def` with `^:private` "
"for values) is a convenience for a developer to indicate which parts of an API should be considered public for use vs "
"part of the implementation."
