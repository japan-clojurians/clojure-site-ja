"We are building a data collection, management, and visualization platform targeted at humanitarian and international "
"development organizations. These organizations, e.g. the World Food Program and UNICEF, use our platform to conduct "
"on-going surveys in the field. Field data is merged with historic data in real-time to construct a comprehensive view "
"of projects they have invested in or are running. This allows organizations to see problems as they occur and make "
"adjustments, e.g. directing health workers to understaffed clinics or inspectors to buildings with more severe "
"damage. The Clojure and ClojureScript component is a stateless layer with all data persistence and retrieval mediated "
"through our API client, https://github.com/onaio/milia/[Milia], and visualization in our ClojureScript data viewers, "
"https://github.com/onaio/hatti[Hatti] and https://github.com/onaio/vega-viewer[Vega-viewer]."
