"The LendUp data engineering team started using Clojure in production to bootstrap some tooling around a few existing "
"ETL pipelines. This experiment proved to be quite successful and as we started to evolve our architecture and move to "
"a more services oriented pattern, we started to adopt Clojure more widely across other parts of our system as well. "
"We now have Clojure services and tooling powering our data pipelines and core real-time decisioning & servicing "
"infrastructure."

"We have been using https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring[Ring] and https://github.com/plumatic/schema[Schema] "
"extensively at LendUp. Ring is an elegant web framework that enables us to quickly start up a web application and "
"leverage a large selection of pre-written middlewares. Coming from a Java background, we definitely miss the static "
"type checking. The Schema library is a solid alternative to a full-blown type system, and it has helped us ensure the "
"contracts over data from internal functions and external services."

"Some of the language features, especially the ability to express \"code as data\" and macro support, has enabled to "

"At LendUp, we have a set of engineering values that guide us as individuals and teams: pragmatism, simplicity, "
"relentlessness, collaboration, ownership and excellence. Clojure fits nicely into our value system. It's made "
"enterprise software development a lot more fun. We're able to iterate on changes faster, build composable and focused "
"components, leverage massive amount of battle-tested, production-ready Java libraries, and we have a much smaller "
"code base to maintain."
