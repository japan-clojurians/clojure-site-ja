"Empear launched in 2015 and we used Clojure from the start. Prior to that I "
"used Clojure for some of my side projects. Clojure was a natural step. I've "
"been a big fan of Lisp for a decade and to be able to use a Lisp together "
"with the ecosystem of the JVM was attractive."

"Our main data source is version-control repositories, which CodeScene views "
"as a behavioral log of how the developers interact with the codebase. This "
"means we can prioritize based on how the system grows and also include a "
"social dimension of code that lets our customers discover team productivity "
"bottlenecks and save on- and off-boarding costs."

"The nature of Clojure and its tight integration with Java makes using "
"Clojure libraries more of an optional convenience. Some high-quality "
"libraries that we enjoy are https://github.com/ptaoussanis/carmine[Carmine], "
"https://github.com/ptaoussanis/timbre[Timbre], and https://github.com/"
"dakrone/cheshire[Cheshire]. We also found https://github.com/weavejester/"
"ragtime[Ragtime] helpful for database migrations. In addition, we use "
"several libraries for statistics and machine learning, although we often end-"
"up implementing our core algorithms ourselves."

"The most rewarding aspect of Clojure is that the language lets you focus on "
"the problem domain. \"What does the data look like? How should we filter and "
"transform it before we pass it on? Let's run this in the REPL and see what "
"happens. OK, now put that in a function. Write a spec for it and stabilize "
"it with tests.\" That workflow ties in really nice to how human problem "
"solving works. In practice it lets us implement new features at a rapid pace."

"The most important feature is Clojure's persistent immutable data "

"We also like Clojure spec. Prior to spec we'd reached a point where certain "
"functions got hard to reason about in isolation. That meant we had to look "
"at the calling context to find out what data structures the code operated on "
"and what it actually did. This is of course something that hits you in all "
"dynamically typed languages, but the issue seemed more pronounced due to the "
"high abstraction levels that Clojure encourages. spec helped a lot by making "
"the code easier to reason about, which IMHO is the single most important "
"aspect to optimize when it comes to software development."

"There are two main reasons. First of all, when we started up I was the only "
"programmer and I knew we had to iterate fast to build something useful. That "
"meant I had to use my time as efficiently as possible. Clojure was an "
"enabler that allowed me to quickly prototype a new idea, evaluate it, and "
"then iterate until we had a stable solution. This is an aspect of Clojure "
"that we still benefit from since we're exploring a new domain with our "
"analyses."

"The second reason isn't technical at all. One of the main reasons I chose "
"Clojure for Empear was because the language looked fun. And fun is a much "
"underestimated motivator in the software industry; Fun is virtually a "
"guarantee that things get done."
