"https://www.anychart.com/[AnyChart] started in 2003 as a provider of Flash-"
"based solutions for interactive data visualization. Then, in several years, "
"we moved to JavaScript HTML5 as a more promising technology. Not having "
"stopped further developing, AnyChart started working with Clojure in early "
"2014 and with ClojureScript in 2015, and we are glad to say they've been "
"among the technologies fueling our global leadership in data visualization "
