"Persistent data structures reduce cognitive load and eliminate an entire class of errors caused by mutation. REPL-"
"driven development provides immediate feedback and is more enjoyable, helping us rapidly deliver features to "
"customers. Java interop lets us leverage existing libraries and benefit from the maturity of the JVM. The standard "
"library is built around simple, powerful, and composable data manipulation functions. Overall, Clojure makes our code "
"more enjoyable to write, pleasant to read, and easier to review."
