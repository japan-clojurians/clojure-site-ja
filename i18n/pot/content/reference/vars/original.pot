"Clojure is a practical language that recognizes the occasional need to "
"maintain a persistent reference to a changing value and provides 4 distinct "
"mechanisms for doing so in a controlled manner - Vars, <<refs#,Refs>>, "
"<<agents#,Agents>> and <<atoms#,Atoms>>. Vars provide a mechanism to refer "
"to a mutable storage location that can be dynamically rebound (to a new "
"storage location) on a per-thread basis. Every Var can (but needn't) have a "
"root binding, which is a binding that is shared by all threads that do not "
"have a per-thread binding. Thus, the value of a Var is the value of its per-"
"thread binding, or, if it is not bound in the thread requesting the value, "
"the value of the root binding, if any."
