"Like Refs, Agents provide shared access to mutable state. Where <<refs#,"
"Refs>> support _coordinated_, _synchronous_ change of _multiple_ locations, "
"Agents provide _independent_, _asynchronous_ change of _individual_ "
"locations. Agents are bound to a single storage location for their lifetime, "
"and only allow mutation of that location (to a new state) to occur as a "
"result of an action. Actions are functions (with, optionally, additional "
"arguments) that are asynchronously applied to an Agent's state and whose "
"return value becomes the Agent's new state. Because actions are functions "
"they can also be multimethods and therefore actions are potentially "
"polymorphic. Also, because the set of functions is open, the set of actions "
"supported by an Agent is also open, a sharp contrast to pattern matching "
"message handling loops provided by some other languages."
