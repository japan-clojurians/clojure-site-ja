"Atoms provide a way to manage shared, synchronous, independent state. They "
"are a reference type like refs and vars. You create an atom with https://"
"clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.core-api.html#clojure.core/atom[atom], and "
"can access its state with https://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.core-api."
"html#clojure.core/deref[deref/@]. Like refs and agents, atoms support "
"validators. To change the value of an atom, you can use https://clojure."
"github.io/clojure/clojure.core-api.html#clojure.core/swap![swap!]. A lower-"
"level https://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.core-api.html#clojure.core/"
"compare-and-set![compare-and-set!] is also provided. Changes to atoms are "
"always free of race conditions."

"As with all reference types, the intended use of atom is to hold one of "
"Clojure's immutable data structures. And, similar to ref's alter and agent's "
"send, you change the value by applying a function to the old value. This is "
"done in an atomic manner by https://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.core-"
"api.html#clojure.core/swap![swap!] Internally, https://clojure.github.io/"
"clojure/clojure.core-api.html#clojure.core/swap![swap!] reads the current "
"value, applies the function to it, and attempts to compare-and-set! it in. "
"Since another thread may have changed the value in the intervening time, it "
"may have to retry, and does so in a spin loop. The net effect is that the "
"value will always be the result of the application of the supplied function "
"to a current value, atomically. However, because the function might be "
"called multiple times, it must be free of side effects."

"Atoms are an efficient way to represent some state that will never need to "
"be coordinated with any other, and for which you wish to make synchronous "
"changes (unlike agents, which are similarly independent but asynchronous). A "
"typical usage might be for memoization:"
