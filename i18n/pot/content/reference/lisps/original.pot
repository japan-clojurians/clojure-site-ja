"A big difference in Clojure, is sequences. Sequences are not specific "
"collections, esp. they are not necessarily concrete lists. When you ask an "
"empty collection for a sequence of its elements (by calling *seq*) it "
"returns _**nil**_, saying \"I can't produce one\". When you ask a sequence "
"on its last element for the _**rest**_ it returns _**another logical "
"sequence.**_ You can only tell if that sequence is empty by calling *seq* on "
"it in turn. This enables sequences and the sequence protocol to be _lazy_."

"Some of the sequence functions correspond to functions from Scheme and CL "
"that there manipulated only pairs/conses ('lists') and returned sentinel "
"values ('() and nil) that represented 'empty' lists. The Clojure return "
"values differ in not returning specific empty collections, but rather "
"another logical sequence. Some of the sequence functions have no counterpart "
"in Scheme/CL, and map to Haskell/ML-like functions. Some of those functions "
"return infinite or calculated sequences, where the analogy to concrete data-"
"structures like Scheme/CL lists is tenuous at best."
