"Clojure is written in terms of abstractions. There are abstractions for "
"sequences, collections, callability, etc. In addition, Clojure supplies many "
"implementations of these abstractions. The abstractions are specified by "
"host interfaces, and the implementations by host classes. While this was "
"sufficient for bootstrapping the language, it left Clojure without similar "
"abstraction and low-level implementation facilities. The <<protocols#,"
"protocols>> and <<datatypes#,datatypes>> features add powerful and flexible "
"mechanisms for abstraction and data structure definition with no compromises "
"vs the facilities of the host platform."

"not merely host-in-parens constructs. They support only a circumscribed "

"It ends up that classes in most OO programs fall into two distinct "
"categories: those classes that are artifacts of the implementation/"
"programming domain, e.g. String or collection classes, or Clojure's "
"reference types; and classes that represent application domain information, "
"e.g. Employee, PurchaseOrder etc. It has always been an unfortunate "
"characteristic of using classes for application domain information that it "
"resulted in information being hidden behind class-specific micro-languages, "
"e.g. even the seemingly harmless employee.getName() is a custom interface to "
"data. Putting information in such classes is a problem, much like having "
"every book being written in a different language would be a problem. You can "
"no longer take a generic approach to information processing. This results in "
"an explosion of needless specificity, and a dearth of reuse."

"This is why Clojure has always encouraged putting such information in maps, "
"and that advice doesn't change with datatypes. By using defrecord you get "
"generically manipulable information, plus the added benefits of type-driven "
"polymorphism, and the structural efficiencies of fields. OTOH, it makes no "
"sense for a datatype that defines a collection like vector to have a default "
