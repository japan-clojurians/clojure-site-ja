"It's an interesting question. Clojure data structures use mutation every "
"time you call, e.g. *assoc*, creating one or more arrays and mutating them, "
"before returning them for immutable use thereafter. The reason is "
"performance - you simply can't get as fast using only pure functions and "
"immutable data. Once constructed and shared however, being immutable and "
"persistent is essential to robust programs. The things Clojure mutates "
"internally are small, newly allocated arrays that constitute the internal "
"nodes of its data structures. No one ever sees the arrays."

"You run into a similar scenario, at a higher level, when you want to "
"initialize or transform a large persistent data structure using multiple "
"steps, none of which will be seen by any code other than the constructing/"
"transforming code. The challenge here is that the source of a transformation "
"will be an existing persistent data structure, and the result of the "
"function _will_ be shared. Copying into a traditional mutable data structure "
"and back involves O(n) copying, and the internal code is an imperative mess "
"quite unlike the rest of your Clojure code. Furthermore, there are no guards "
"against accidentally sharing or aliasing the mutable data structure, "
"especially if you need to call helper functions to do the work. In short, it "
"would be a shame if you had to leave Clojure's model in order to speed up a "
"piece of code like this. Transient data structures are a solution to this "
"optimization problem that integrates with the Clojure model and provides the "
"same thread safety guarantees you expect of Clojure."

msgid ""
"Transient data structures are always created from an existing persistent "
"Clojure data structure. As of Clojure 1.1.0, vectors, hash-maps, and hash-"
"sets are supported. Note that not all Clojure data structures can support "
"this feature, but most will. Lists will not, as there is no benefit to be "
"had."

"You obtain a transient 'copy' of a data structure by calling *transient*. "
"This creates a new transient data structure that is a copy of the source, "
"and has the same performance characteristics. In fact, it mostly _is_ the "
"source data structure, and highlights the first feature of transients - "
"creating one is O(1). It shares structure with its source, just as "
"persistent copies share structure."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: en/content/reference/transients.adoc:33

"The second feature of transients is that creating one does not modify the "
"source, and the source cannot be modified via use of the transient. Your "
"source data is immutable and persistent as always."

#. type: Plain text

"Transients support the read-only interface of the source, i.e. you can call "
"*nth*, *get*, *count* and fn-call a transient vector, just like a persistent "
"vector."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: en/content/reference/transients.adoc:37
msgid ""
"Transients _**do not**_ support the persistent interface of the source data "
"structure. *assoc*, *conj* etc will all throw exceptions, because transients "
"are not persistent. Thus you cannot accidentally leak a transient into a "
"context requiring a persistent."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text

"Transients support a parallel set of 'changing' operations, with similar "
"names followed by *!* - *assoc!*, *conj!* etc. These do the same things as "
"their persistent counterparts except the return values are themselves "
"transient. Note in particular that transients are not designed to be bashed "
"in-place. You must capture and use the return value in the next call. In "
"this way, they support the same code structure as the functional persistent "
"code they replace. As the example will show, this will allow you to easily "
"enhance the performance of a piece of code without structural change."

"When you are finished building up your results, you can create a persistent "
"data structure by calling *persistent!* on the transient. This operation is "
"also O(1). Subsequent to calling *persistent!*, the transient should not be "

"any aliases you might have created."
