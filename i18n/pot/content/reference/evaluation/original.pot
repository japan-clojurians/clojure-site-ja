"Clojure programs are composed of expressions. Every form not handled "

"expression, which is evaluated to yield a value. There are no declarations "
"or statements, although sometimes expressions may be evaluated for their "
"side-effects and their values ignored.  In all cases, evaluation is the same "
"- a single object is considered by the compiler, evaluated, and its result "
"returned. If an expression needs to be compiled, it will be. There is no "
"separate compilation step, nor any need to worry that a function you have "
"defined is being interpreted. _Clojure has no interpreter_."
