"Clojure 1.7 introduced a new extension (.cljc) for portable files that can "
"be loaded by multiple Clojure platforms. The primary mechanism for managing "
"platform-specific code is to isolate that code into a minimal set of "
"namespaces, and then provide platform-specific versions (.clj/.class or ."
"cljs) of those namespaces."

"In cases where is not feasible to isolate the varying parts of the code, or "
"where the code is mostly portable with only small platform-specific parts, "
"1.7 also introduced _reader conditionals_, which are supported only in cljc "
"files and at the default REPL. Reader conditionals should be used sparingly "
"and only when necessary."

"Reader conditionals are a new reader dispatch form starting with `pass:[#?]` "
"or `pass:[#?@]`. Both consist of a series of alternating features and "
"expressions, similar to `cond`. Every Clojure platform has a well-known "
"\"platform feature\" - `:clj`, `:cljs`, `:cljr`. Each condition in a reader "
"conditional is checked in order until a feature matching the platform "
"feature is found. The reader conditional will read and return that feature's "
"expression. The expression on each non-selected branch will be read but "
"skipped. A well-known `:default` feature will always match and can be used "
"to provide a default. If no branches match, no form will be read (as if no "
"reader conditional expression was present)."
