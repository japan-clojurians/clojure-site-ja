"Reducers provide an alternative approach to using <<sequences#,sequences>> "
"to manipulate standard Clojure collections. Sequence functions are typically "
"applied lazily, in order, create intermediate results, and in a single "
"thread. However, many sequence functions (like map and filter) could "
"conceptually be applied in parallel, yielding code that will get faster "
"automatically as machines get more cores. For more details on the rationale "
"for reducers, see the original http://clojure.com/blog/2012/05/08/reducers-a-"

"A _reducer_ is the combination of a _reducible collection_ (a collection "
"that knows how to reduce itself) with a _reducing function_ (the \"recipe\" "
"for what needs to be done during the reduction). The standard sequence "
"operations are replaced with new versions that do not perform the operation "
"but merely transform the reducing function. Execution of the operations is "
"deferred until the final reduction is performed. This removes the "
"intermediate results and lazy evaluation seen with sequences."
