"Persistent data structures reduce cognitive load and eliminate an entire "
"class of errors caused by mutation. REPL-driven development provides "
"immediate feedback and is more enjoyable, helping us rapidly deliver "
"features to customers. Java interop lets us leverage existing libraries and "
"benefit from the maturity of the JVM. The standard library is built around "
"simple, powerful, and composable data manipulation functions. Overall, "
"Clojure makes our code more enjoyable to write, pleasant to read, and easier "
"to review."
