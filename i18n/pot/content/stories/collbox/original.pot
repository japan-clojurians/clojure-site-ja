"I've been using Clojure for about five years, and ClojureScript for one "
"year. I discovered Lisps early in my programming career (probably via Emacs) "
"and thus have been a Lisp fan for about 15 years, so Clojure felt like "
"coming home."

"We're using Clojure and ClojureScript to build the next generation of debt "

"conveniently ingest and validate debt, manage a network of reputable debt "
"collectors behind the scenes, and intelligently match debt with collectors "
"to optimize for the best rates and odds of collection. At the same time, "
"we're working to raise the bar on accountability and transparency in an "
"industry that has historically not been known for those things."

"Just me! We're a small startup, and I comprise the engineering team (for "

"Connect Hackathon, where we beat out teams with five professional engineers "
"who work together every day—again, with Clojure and one engineer. A good "

"The single most valuable aspect of working with Clojure, for me, is the "
"language's commitment to reusing a small number of readable, immutable data "
"structures. I configure my application with basic data structures; I wire my "
"application's dependencies together with basic data structures; I write my "
"database queries in them, I log metrics with them, and when I have to "
"diagnose a web exception at 2am, I'm very fortunate that that request came "
"in as a familiar data structure that I can print, log, inspect, or update "
"with the same tools I've spent years getting comfortable with."
