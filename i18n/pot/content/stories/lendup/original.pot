"The LendUp data engineering team started using Clojure in production to "
"bootstrap some tooling around a few existing ETL pipelines. This experiment "
"proved to be quite successful and as we started to evolve our architecture "
"and move to a more services oriented pattern, we started to adopt Clojure "
"more widely across other parts of our system as well. We now have Clojure "
"services and tooling powering our data pipelines and core real-time "
"decisioning & servicing infrastructure."

"We have been using https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring[Ring] and https://"
"github.com/plumatic/schema[Schema] extensively at LendUp. Ring is an elegant "
"web framework that enables us to quickly start up a web application and "
"leverage a large selection of pre-written middlewares. Coming from a Java "
"background, we definitely miss the static type checking. The Schema library "
"is a solid alternative to a full-blown type system, and it has helped us "
"ensure the contracts over data from internal functions and external services."

"Some of the language features, especially the ability to express \"code as "
"data\" and macro support, has enabled to create pretty effective DSLs to "
"express pretty complex business logic. The built in support for immutability "
"in the language and data structures have also fundamentally changed our code "
"base and data architecture as well."

"At LendUp, we have a set of engineering values that guide us as individuals "
"and teams: pragmatism, simplicity, relentlessness, collaboration, ownership "
"and excellence. Clojure fits nicely into our value system. It's made "
"enterprise software development a lot more fun. We're able to iterate on "
"changes faster, build composable and focused components, leverage massive "
"amount of battle-tested, production-ready Java libraries, and we have a much "
"smaller code base to maintain."
