"We really like working with the JVM, and wish to continue leveraging this "

"Our prior experience with Java projects showed that it was a poor fit for "

"The language lets us seamlessly use existing Java libraries and tools in our "

"Clojure allows us to develop the system interactively, and to quickly "

"Clojure based solutions end up having a fraction of the code seen in the "
"projects of similar scope that we previously built in Java. Not only that, "
"but Clojure makes it much easier to separate the intent of the code from the "
"implementation details. The ability to separate what is being done from how "
"it is done results in code that's much easier to maintain."

"Clojure's focus on immutability facilitates a natural decoupling between "
"parts of the application. In absence of shared global state, it becomes "
"possible to work on parts of the application in isolation. The resulting "
"code requires fewer tests since the functions are pure and do not depend on "
"the overall application state."

"Since Clojure is a small and focused language, it made it easy to train new "
