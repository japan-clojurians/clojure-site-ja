"However, the most eye opening and educational library we have used is Ring - "
"it was a paradigm shift to see how http requests could be modeled as simple "
"data and then passed through the system.  Once we realized that requests "
"could be modeled as data, we were able to just let the requests flow through "
"our system making transformations as needed.  That was a key learning for us "
"and really helped us to understand more about designing systems based on "
"data flow, which I detail further in https://medium.com/@chris.shellenbarger/"

"Most recently, using spec has been really great.  The idea of generational "
"tests has been game changing for us.  It also has provided us with, what we "
"think is, an improvement over static typed system for defining functional "
"contracts and validating programs.  We can now validate based on the 'shape' "
"of the data or even specific values - this goes miles beyond the limits of "
"what traditional type systems provide."

"We absolutely love the power that comes with passing around maps and letting "

"Modeling our system state as maps has also been enlightening.  It allows us "
"to understand our system better by looking at maps of data rather than a "
"large object hierarchy. Combined with immutability, this makes Clojure a joy "
"to work with."

msgid "Clojure is valuable to our business because we can do so much more with less.   We have a very small team and we are usually able to add features within a couple of hours.   We achieve this power because we flow data through the system and adding new features tends to be just about figuring out where best to plug into that flow.  Once that's decided, we can hook in and not worry about impacting state in other areas of the code thanks to immutability.\n"
