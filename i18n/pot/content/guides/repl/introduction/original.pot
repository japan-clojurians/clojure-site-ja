"The Clojure REPL gives the programmer an interactive development "
"experience.  When developing new functionality, it enables her to build "
"programs first by performing small tasks manually, as if she _were_ the "
"computer, then gradually make them more and more automated, until the "
"desired functionality is fully programmed. When debugging, the REPL makes "
"the execution of her programs feel _tangible:_ it enables the programmer to "
"rapidly reproduce the problem, observe its symptoms closely, then improvise "
"experiments to rapidly narrow down the cause of the bug and iterate towards "
"a fix."

msgid ""
"Many Clojure programmers consider the REPL, and the tight feedback loop it "
"provides, to be the most compelling reason to use Clojure. This does not "
"mean that the language features of Clojure, such as immutable data "
"structures, are not valuable: the Clojure REPL gets most of its leverage "
"_because_ of these features, in particular because Clojure was designed with "
"interactive development in mind."
