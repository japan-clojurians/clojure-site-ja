"Clojure is a dynamic language, and thus far we have relied on documentation "
"or external libraries to explain the use and behavior of functions and "
"libraries. But documentation is difficult to produce, is frequently not "
"maintained, cannot be automatically checked and varies greatly in quality. "
"Specs are expressive and precise. Including **spec** in Clojure creates a "
"lingua franca with which we can state how our programs work and how to use "
"them."

"A key advantage of specifications over documentation is the leverage they "
"provide. In particular, specs can be utilized by programs in ways that docs "
"cannot. Defining specs takes effort, and **spec** aims to maximize the "
"return you get from making that effort. **spec** gives you tools for "
"leveraging specs in documentation, validation, error reporting, "
"destructuring, instrumentation, test-data generation and generative testing."

"Error messages from macros are a perennial challenge for new (and "
"experienced) users of Clojure. Specs can be used to conform data in macros "
"instead of using a custom parser. And Clojure's macro expansion will "
"automatically use specs, when present, to explain errors to users. This "
"should result in a greatly improved experience for users when errors occur."

"Clojure has always been about simplifying the development of robust "
"software. In all languages, dynamic or not, tests are essential to quality - "
"too many critical properties are not captured by common type systems. "
"**spec** has been designed from the ground up to directly support generative "
"testing via https://github.com/clojure/test.check[test.check]. When you use "
"**spec** you get generative tests for free."

"Taken together, I think the features of **spec** demonstrate the ongoing "
"advantages of a powerful dynamic language like Clojure for building robust "
"software - superior expressivity, instrumentation-enhanced REPL-driven "
"development, sophisticated testing and more flexible systems. I encourage "
"you to read the **spec** https://clojure.org/about/spec[rationale and "
"overview]. Look for spec's inclusion in the next alpha release of Clojure, "
"within a day or so."
