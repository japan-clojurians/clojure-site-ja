"Clojure has been very fortunate to receive infrastructure support from "
"https://www.atlassian.com[Atlassian] (for JIRA and Confluence) and https://"
"www.contegix.com/[Contegix] (for hosting) for many years. The Confluence and "
"JIRA instances were not kept up to date, and have grown increasingly hard to "
"maintain. Recently, we decided to shut down Confluence (content was either "
"moved to https://clojure.org[clojure.org] or https://archive.clojure.org/"
"design-wiki/display/design/Home.html[archived]) and we are now preparing to "
"migrate from our old JIRA instance into a new cloud-hosted instance. Many "
"thanks to Atlassian again for supporting our efforts in this."

"Due to the large number of users, it is not feasible for us to move "
"everyone, and we've decided to migrate all users that have edited tickets in "
"the past (changed a description, added a patch, etc) - this will move user "
"names and emails, not passwords. When the import happens, email invites will "
"go out for users in the new system based on the email address in the old "
"system. Initially these users will not have access to projects."

"Users that created or commented on tickets in the past (but did not edit) "
"will not automatically be migrated. We are planning to leverage JIRA Service "
"Desk to create a new path for language users to file tickets without needing "
"an account. These incoming tickets can be triaged and turned into JIRA "
"tickets as needed. We are also looking at a new process to obtain a "
"contributor account and gain access to the system for commenting or other "
"work. Stay tuned for more on that."
