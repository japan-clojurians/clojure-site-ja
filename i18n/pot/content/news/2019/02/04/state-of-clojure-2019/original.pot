"For years we have asked people what aspects of Clojure were most important "
"to them. These answers are remarkably consistent and this year was no "
"different. However it is good to reexamine these strengths to see why "
"developers value Clojure. The big four that are always at the top of the "
"list are: functional programming, immutability, the REPL, and ease of "
"development. These traits are interrelated. Language support for immutable "
"persistent data structures makes functional programming idiomatic and "
"effective. A REPL on a live, growing system, with data loaded, is a great "
"way for developers to try their new code in context as it is written, "
"improving quality."
