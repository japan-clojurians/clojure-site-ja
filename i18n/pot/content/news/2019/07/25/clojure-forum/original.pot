"We are pleased to announce today a new forum for Clojure and ClojureScript "

"The new forum was seeded with all of the open JIRA issues, one question per "
"issue with JIRA comments turned into answers. Over time, we expect this site "
"to serve as a persistent store of common questions, answers, etc - it is "
"open for web indexing and has both search and \"similar question\" "
"functionality to help you find previous related discussions. This addresses "
"one of the biggest issues with current places to ask questions about Clojure "
"- the ability to search and find similar prior discussions."

"For problems and enhancements, we have been using JIRA for years (and will "
"continue to do so). However, there are naturally two audiences for issues, "
"users and developers, who have different needs. The new forum will serve as "
"the primary place for users to ask questions about potential problems or "
"request possible enhancments. Authentication occurs via GitHub (other auth "
"providers may be added in the future). No contributor agreement is needed."

"Developers on Clojure, ClojureScript, etc will monitor these forums and "
"create JIRAs when necessary. Any user may vote on questions in the forum and "
"the dev teams can use this information when prioritizing fixes and "
"enhancements. This capability has been available in JIRA for many years, but "
"it was too much of a barrier to receive feedback from casual users. The new "
"forum greatly reduces this friction. JIRA will still be used by developers "
"submitting and working on patches, but not for initial problem reporting."
