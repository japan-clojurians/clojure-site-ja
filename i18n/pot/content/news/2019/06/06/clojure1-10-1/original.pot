"Recent builds of Java 8 (u202), 11 (11.0.2), 12, and 13 included some "
"changes that drastically affect optimization performance of calls from "
"static initializers to static fields. Clojure provides support for loading "
"code on startup from a user.clj file and this occurred in the static "
"initializer of the Clojure runtime (RT) class and was thus affected."

"This issue may eventually be resolved in Java, but in Clojure we have "
"modified runtime initialization to avoid loading user.clj in a static "
"initializer, which mitigates the case where this caused a performance "
"degradation."
