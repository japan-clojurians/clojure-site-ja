"First and foremost, Clojure is dynamic. That means that a Clojure program is "
"not just something you compile and run, but something with which you can "
"interact. Clojure is not a language abstraction, but an environment, where "
"almost all of the language constructs are reified, and thus can be examined "
"and changed. This leads to a substantially different experience from running "
"a program, examining its results (or failures) and trying again. In "
"particular, you can grow your program, with data loaded, adding features, "
"fixing bugs, testing, in an unbroken stream."

"While Clojure can be embedded in a Java application, or used as a scripting "

"(REPL). This is a simple console interface that allows you to enter and "
"execute commands, and examine their results. You can start the Clojure REPL "
"like this, and then follow along trying the samples in this feature tour:"
