"Today's systems have to deal with many simultaneous tasks and leverage the "
"power of multi-core CPUs. Doing so with threads can be very difficult due to "
"the complexities of synchronization. Clojure simplifies multi-threaded "
"programming in several ways. Because the core data structures are immutable, "
"they can be shared readily between threads. However, it is often necessary "
"to have state change in a program. Clojure, being a practical language, "
"allows state to change but provides mechanism to ensure that, when it does "
"so, it remains consistent, while alleviating developers from having to avoid "
"conflicts manually using locks etc. The <<xref/../../reference/refs#,"
"software transactional memory system>> (STM), exposed through https://"

"html#clojure.core/alter[alter], et al, supports _sharing_ changing state "
"between threads in a _synchronous_ and _coordinated_ manner. The "
"<<xref/../../reference/agents#,agent>> system supports sharing changing "
"state between threads in an _asynchronous_ and _independent_ manner. The "
"<<xref/../../reference/atoms#,atoms>> system supports sharing changing state "

"transactions. If a conflict occurs between 2 transactions trying to modify "
"the same reference, one of them will be retried. All of this occurs without "
