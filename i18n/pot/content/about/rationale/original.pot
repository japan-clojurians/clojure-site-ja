"Customers and stakeholders have substantial investments in, and are "
"comfortable with the performance, security and stability of, industry-"
"standard platforms like the JVM. While Java developers may envy the "
"succinctness, flexibility and productivity of dynamic languages, they have "
"concerns about running on customer-approved infrastructure, access to their "
"existing code base and libraries, and performance. In addition, they face "
"ongoing problems dealing with concurrency using native threads and locking. "
"Clojure is an effort in pragmatic dynamic language design in this context. "
"It endeavors to be a general-purpose language suitable in those areas where "
"Java is suitable. It reflects the reality that, for the concurrent "
"programming future, pervasive, unmoderated mutation simply has to go."

"agents. The result is robust, practical, and fast."
