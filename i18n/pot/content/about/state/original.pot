"OO is, among other things, an attempt to provide tools for modeling identity "

"hierarchical classification, both ignored here). OO typically unifies "
"identity and state, i.e. an object (identity) is a pointer to the memory "
"that contains the value of its state. There is no way to obtain the state "
"independent of the identity other than copying it. There is no way to "
"observe a stable state (even to copy it) without blocking others from "
"changing it. There is no way to associate the identity's state with a "
"different value other than in-place memory mutation. In other words, "
"*_typical OO has imperative programming baked into it!_* OO doesn't have to "

"People accustomed to OO conceive of their programs as mutating the values of "

"that would never change, but usually don't extend that notion of value to "

"languages use the same constructs for modeling values as they do for "
"identities, objects, and default to mutability, causing all but the most "
"disciplined programmers to create many more identities than they should, "
"creating identities out of things that should be values etc."

"There is another way, and that is to separate identity and state (once "
"again, indirection saves the day in programming). We need to move away from "
"a notion of state as \"the content of this memory block\" to one of \"the "
"*_value_* currently associated with this identity\". Thus an identity can be "
"in different states at different times, but _the state itself doesn't "
"change_. That is, an identity is not a state, an identity *_has_* a state. "
"Exactly one state at any point in time. And that state is a true value, i.e. "
"it never changes. If an identity appears to change, it is because it becomes "
"associated with different state values over time. This is the Clojure model."

"In Clojure's model, value calculation is purely functional. Values never "

"refs#,Refs>> and <<xref/../../reference/agents#,Agents>>). Changes to "
"references are controlled/coordinated by the system - i.e. cooperation is "
"not optional and not manual. The world moves forward due to the cooperative "
"efforts of its participants and the programming language/system, Clojure, is "

"Dealing with concurrency means giving up the illusion of omnipotence. A "
"program must recognize there will be other participants, and the world will "
"keep changing. So a program must understand that if it observes the values "
"of the states of some identities, the best it can get is a snapshot, as they "
"can subsequently acquire new states. But often that is good enough for "
"decision making or reporting purposes. We humans do quite well with the "
"snapshots provided by our sensory systems. The nice thing is any such state "
"value won't change in hand during the processing, as it is immutable."

"On the other hand, changing state to a new value requires access to the "
"'current' value and the identity. Clojure's Refs and Agents handle this "
"automatically. In the case of Refs, any interaction you do must occur within "
"a transaction (else Clojure will throw an exception), all such interaction "
"will see a consistent view of the world as of a point in time, and no "
"changes will proceed unless the states to be changed haven't been changed by "
"other participants in the meantime. Transactions support synchronous change "
"to multiple Refs. Agents, OTOH, offer asynchronous change to a single "
"reference. You pass a function and values, and, at some point in the future, "
"that function will be passed the current state of the Agent and the return "
"value of the function will become the Agent's new state."

"In all cases the program will see stable views of the values in the world, "
"as those values can't change, and sharing them among cores is fine. The "
"trick is, \"values never change\" means that making new values from old ones "
"must be efficient, and it is in Clojure, due to its persistent data "
"structures. They allow you to finally follow the oft-proffered advice to "
"favor immutability. So you set the state of an identity to a new state by "
"reading its current value, calling a pure function on that value to create a "
"new value, and setting that value as the new state. These composite "
"operations are made easy and atomic by the https://clojure.github.com/"

"wiki/Erlang_%28programming_language%29[Erlang]. In an actor model, state is "

"passing of messages (values). In an asynchronous system like Erlang's, "
"reading some aspect of an actor's state requires sending a request message, "
"waiting for a response, and the actor sending a response. It is important to "
"understand that _the actor model was designed to address the problems of "
"*distributed* programs_. And the problems of distributed programs are much "
"harder - there are multiple worlds (address spaces), direct observation is "
"not possible, interaction occurs over possibly unreliable channels, etc. The "
"actor model supports transparent distribution. If you write all of your code "
