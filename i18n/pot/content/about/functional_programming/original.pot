"Clojure is a functional programming language. It provides the tools to avoid "
"mutable state, provides functions as first-class objects, and emphasizes "
"recursive iteration instead of side-effect based looping. Clojure is "
"_impure_, in that it doesn't force your program to be referentially "
"transparent, and doesn't strive for 'provable' programs. The philosophy "
"behind Clojure is that most parts of most programs should be functional, and "
"that programs that are more functional are more robust."

"The easiest way to avoid mutating state is to use immutable <<xref/../../"
"reference/data_structures#,data structures>>. Clojure provides a set of "
"immutable lists, vectors, sets and maps. Since they can't be changed, "
"'adding' or 'removing' something from an immutable collection means creating "
"a new collection just like the old one but with the needed change. "
"_Persistence_ is a term used to describe the property wherein the old "
"version of the collection is still available after the 'change', and that "
"the collection maintains its performance guarantees for most operations. "
"Specifically, this means that the new version can't be created using a full "
"copy, since that would require linear time. Inevitably, persistent "
"collections are implemented using linked data structures, so that the new "
"versions can share structure with the prior version. Singly-linked lists and "
"trees are the basic functional data structures, to which Clojure adds a hash "
"map, set and vector both based upon array mapped hash tries. The collections "
"have readable representations and common interfaces:"

"space recursive looping by rebinding and jumping to the nearest enclosing "
"loop or function frame. While not as general as tail-call-optimization, it "
"allows most of the same elegant constructs, and offers the advantage of "
"checking that calls to recur can only happen in a tail position."
