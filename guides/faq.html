<div class="sectionbody">
<div id="why_keywords" class="paragraph">
<p><strong><a href="faq#why_keywords">What&#8217;s the advantage of representing text tokens as keywords (instead of as strings)?</a></strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Keywords are cached and interned. This means that a keyword is reused (reducing memory) everywhere in your program and that checks for equality really become checks for identity (which are fast). Additionally, keywords are invokable to look themselves up in a map and thus this enables the common pattern of extracting a particular field from a collection of maps possible.</p>
</div>
<div id="unreadable_keywords" class="paragraph">
<p><strong><a href="faq#unreadable_keywords">Why is it possible to create keywords that can&#8217;t be read by the reader?</a></strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href="https://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.core-api.html#clojure.core/keyword"><code>keyword</code></a> function can be used to programmatically create keywords based on user data or other sources of input. Similarly, the <a href="https://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.core-api.html#clojure.core/namespace"><code>namespace</code></a> and <a href="https://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.core-api.html#clojure.core/name"><code>name</code></a> functions can be used to pull a keyword back apart into components. It is common for programs to use this functionality to create keywords to be used as identifiers or map keys without ever printing and reading that data back.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because of this use case (and also for general performance), no validation check is performed on the inputs to <code>keyword</code> (or <code>symbol</code>), which makes it possible to create keywords that, when printed, cannot be read back into a keyword (due to spaces or other non-allowed characters). If this is important to you, you should validate the keyword inputs first, before creating the keyword.</p>
</div>
<div id="reader_macros" class="paragraph">
<p><strong><a href="faq#reader_macros">Why does Clojure not have user-extensible reader macros?</a></strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The reader takes text (Clojure source) and returns Clojure data, which is subsequently compiled and evaluated. Reader macros tell the Clojure reader how to read something that is not a typical s-expression (examples are things like quoting <code>'</code> and anonymous functions <code>#()</code>). Reader macros can be used to define entirely new syntaxes read by the reader (for example: JSON, XML, or other formats) - this is a more powerful syntactic capability than regular macros (which come into play later at compile time).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, unlike Lisp, Clojure does not allow the user to extend this set of reader macros. This avoids the possibility of creating code that another user cannot read (because they do not have the proper reader macros). Clojure gives back some of the power of reader macros with tagged literals, allowing you to create generically readable <em>data</em>, that is still extensible.</p>
</div>
<div id="underscore" class="paragraph">
<p><strong><a href="faq#underscore">What does an _ mean in a let binding or parameter?</a></strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>_ has no special meaning in Clojure as a symbol. However, it is a convention to use _ (or a leading _) to denote a binding that will not be used in the expression. A common case for this is skipping unneeded values in <a href="destructuring#_sequential_destructuring">sequential destructuring</a>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint highlight"><code class="language-clojure" data-lang="clojure">(defn get-y [point]
  (let [[_ y] point]   ;; x-value of point is unused, so mark it with _
    y))</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div id="anon_vector" class="paragraph">
<p><strong><a href="faq#anon_vector">Why doesn&#8217;t the anonymous function <code>#([%1])</code> work to construct a vector?</a></strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>#()</code> always expands to include parens around the expression you give it, thus in this case it yields <code>(fn [x] ([x]))</code> which fails when the vector is invoked. Instead, use the vector function <code>#(vector %)</code> or just <code>vector</code>, which is the function being described.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_collections_sequences_and_transducers"><a class="anchor" href="#_collections_sequences_and_transducers"></a>Collections, Sequences, and Transducers</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div id="conj" class="paragraph">
<p><strong><a href="faq#conj">Why does <code>conj</code> add to the front of a list, but the back of a vector?</a></strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most Clojure data structure operations, including <code>conj</code> (conjoin), are designed to give the user a performance expectation. With <code>conj</code>, the expectation is that insertion should happen at the place where this operation is efficient. Lists (as linked lists) can make a constant time insertion only at the front. Vectors (indexed) are designed to expand at the back. As the user, you should consider this when you choose which data structure to use. In Clojure, vectors are used with much greater frequency.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If your goal is specifically to "add to the front of the collection", then the appropriate function to use is <code>cons</code>, which will always add to the front. Note however that this will produce a sequence, not an instance of the original collection type.</p>
</div>
<div id="seqs_vs_colls" class="paragraph">
<p><strong><a href="faq#seqs_vs_colls">I keep forgetting that after calling sequence functions on vectors/sets, the return value is no longer a vector or a set.</a></strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Generally you should divide the Clojure core functions into these two categories:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Data structure functions - take a data structure and return a modified versions of that data structure (conj, disj, assoc, dissoc, etc). These functions always take the data structure <em>first</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sequence functions - take a "seqable" and return a seqable. [Generally we try to avoid committing to the return values actually being an instance of ISeq - this allows for performance optimizations in some cases.] Examples are map, filter, remove, etc. All of these functions take the seqable <em>last</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It sounds like you are using the latter but expecting the semantics of the former (which is a common issue for new Clojurists!). If you want to apply sequence functions but have more control over the output data structure, there are a number of ways to do that.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Use data-structure equivalents like mapv or filterv, etc - this is a very limited set that lets you perform these ops but return a data structure rather than a seqable. <code>(mapv inc (filterv odd? [1 2 3]))</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pour the results of your sequence transformations back into a data structure with into: <code>(into [] (map inc (filter odd? [1 2 3])))</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use transducers (likely with <code>into</code>) - this has much the same effect as #2, but combinations of transformations can be applied more efficiently without creating any sequences - only the final result is built: <code>(into [] (comp (filter odd?) (map inc)) [1 2 3])</code>. As you work with larger sequences or more transformations, this makes a significant difference in performance.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that all of these are eager transformations - they produce the output vector when you invoke them. The original sequence version <code>(map inc (filter odd? [1 2 3]))</code> is lazy and will only produce values as needed (with chunking under the hood for greater performance). Neither of these is right or wrong, but they are both useful in different circumstances.</p>
</div>
<div id="arg_order" class="paragraph">
<p><strong><a href="faq#arg_order">What are the rules of thumb for arg order in core functions?</a></strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Primary collection operands come first. That way one can write <code>&#8594;</code> and
its ilk, and their position is independent of whether or not they have
variable arity parameters. There is a tradition of this in OO
languages and Common Lisp (<code>slot-value</code>, <code>aref</code>, <code>elt</code>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One way to think about sequences is that they are read from the left,
and fed from the right:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint highlight"><code>&lt;- [1 2 3 4]</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most of the sequence functions consume and produce sequences. So one
way to visualize that is as a chain:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint highlight"><code>map &lt;- filter &lt;- [1 2 3 4]</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>and one way to think about many of the seq functions is that they are
parameterized in some way:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint highlight"><code>(map f) &lt;- (filter pred) &lt;- [1 2 3 4]</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, sequence functions take their source(s) last, and any other
parameters before them, and partial allows for direct parameterization
as above. There is a tradition of this in functional languages and
Lisps.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that this is not the same as taking the primary operand last.
Some sequence functions have more than one source (concat,
interleave). When sequence functions are variadic, it is usually in
their sources.</p>

<div id="transducers_vs_seqs" class="paragraph">
<p><strong><a href="faq#transducers_vs_seqs">What are good use cases for transducers?</a></strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When performing a series of transformations, sequences will create an intermediate (cached) sequence between each transformation. Transducers create a single compound transformation that is executed in one eager pass over the input. These are different models, which are both useful.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Performance benefits of transducers:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Source collection iteration - when used on reducible inputs (collections and other things), avoid creating an unnecessary input collection sequence - helps memory and time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Intermediate sequences and cached values - as the transformation happens in a single pass, you remove all intermediate sequence and cached value creation - again, helps memory and time. The combination of the prior item and this one will start to win big as the size of the input collection or number of transformations goes up (but for small numbers of either, chunked sequences can be surprisingly fast and will compete).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Design / usage benefits of transducers:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Transformation composition - some use cases will have a cleaner design if they separate transformation composition from transformation application. Transducers support this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eagerness - transducers are great for cases where eagerly processing a transformation (and potentially encountering any errors) is more important than laziness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resource control - because you have more control over when the input collection is traversed, you also know when processing is complete. It&#8217;s thus easier to release or clean up input resources because you know when that happens.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Performance benefits of sequences:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Laziness - if you will only need some of the outputs (for example a user is deciding how many to use), then lazy sequences can often be more efficient in deferring processing. In particular, sequences can be lazy with intermediate results, but transducers use a pull model that will eagerly produce all intermediate values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Infinite streams - because transducers are typically eagerly consumed, they don&#8217;t match well with infinite streams of values</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Design benefits of sequences:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Consumer control - returning a seq from an API lets you combine input + transformation into something that gives the consumer control. Transducers don&#8217;t work as well for this (but will work better for cases where input and transformation are separated).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_spec"><a class="anchor" href="#_spec"></a>Spec</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div id="spec_alpha" class="paragraph">
<p><strong><a href="faq#spec_alpha">Why is spec alpha?</a></strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>spec is in alpha to indicate that the API may still change. spec was broken out of Clojure core so that spec can be updated independently from the main Clojure version. At some point spec&#8217;s API will be considered stable and at that point the alpha will be removed.</p>
</div>
<div id="spec_location" class="paragraph">
<p><strong><a href="faq#spec_location">Where should I put my specs?</a></strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is no single right answer to this question. For data specs, it is often useful to put them in their own namespace, which may or may not match the qualifier used in the data specs. Matching the qualifier to the namespace allows the use of auto-resolved keywords both within the specs and in aliases in other namespaces, but also entwines them, making refactoring more complicated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For function specs, most people either put them immediately before or after the function they apply to, or in a separate namespace that can optionally be required when needed (for testing or validation). In the latter case, Clojure core has followed the pattern of using foo.bar.specs to hold function specs for the functions in foo.bar.</p>
</div>
<div id="regex_nesting" class="paragraph">
<p><strong><a href="faq#regex_nesting">How do nested regex ops work?</a></strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Regex ops (cat, alt, *, +, ?, etc) always describe the elements in a sequential collection. They are not, by themselves, specs. When used in a spec context they are coerced into specs. Nested regex ops combine to form a single regex spec over the same sequential collection.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To validate a nested collection, use <code>s/spec</code> to wrap the inner regex, forcing a spec boundary between regex ops.</p>
</div>
<div id="instrument_ret" class="paragraph">
<p><strong><a href="faq#instrument_ret">Why doesn&#8217;t <code>instrument</code> check return values?</a></strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Instrument is intended to verify that a function is being invoked according to its args spec. That is, is the function being called correctly? This functionality should be used during development.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Checking whether a function operates correctly is a test-time activity and this should be checked with the <code>check</code> function which will actually invoke the function with generated args and verify the ret and fn specs on each invocation.</p>
</div>
<div id="skip_macros" class="paragraph">
<p><strong><a href="faq#skip_macros">Is there a way to skip checking macro specs?</a></strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Yes, set the Java system property <code>-Dclojure.spec.skip-macros=true</code> and no macro specs will be checked during macroexpansion.</p>

<h2 id="_state_and_concurrency"><a class="anchor" href="#_state_and_concurrency"></a>State and Concurrency</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div id="concurrency_features" class="paragraph">
<p><strong><a href="faq#concurrency_features">What are the trade-offs between reducers, core.async, futures, and pmap?</a></strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each of these really addresses a different use case.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Reducers are best for fine-grained data parallelism when computing a transformation over existing in-memory data (in a map or vector). Generally it&#8217;s best when you have thousands of small data items to compute over and many cores to do the work. Anything described as "embarrassingly parallel".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Futures are best for pushing work onto a background thread and picking it up later (or for doing I/O waits in parallel). It&#8217;s better for big chunky tasks (go fetch a bunch of data in the background).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>core.async is primarily used to organize the subsystems or internal structure of your application. It has channels (queues) to convey values from one "subprocess" (go block) to another. So you&#8217;re really getting concurrency and architectural benefits in how you break up your program. The killer feature you can really only get in core.async is the ability to wait on I/O events from multiple channels for the first response on any of them (via alt/alts). Promises can also be used to convey single values between independent threads/subprocesses but they are single delivery only.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tools like pmap, java.util queues and executors, and libraries like claypoole are doing coarse-level "task" concurrency. There is some overlap with core.async here which has a very useful transducer-friendly pipeline functionality.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="agent_shutdown" class="paragraph">
<p><strong><a href="faq#agent_shutdown">Why does Clojure "hang" for 1 minute when my program ends?</a></strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is most commonly asked in the context of programs that use <code>future</code>, <code>pmap</code>, <code>agent-send</code>, or other functions that invoke those functions. When a program like this finishes, there will be a 60 second pause before exit. To fix this problem, call <a href="https://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.core-api.html#clojure.core/shutdown-agents">shutdown-agents</a> as the program exits.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Clojure uses two internal thread pools to service futures and agent function executions. Both pools use non-daemon threads and the JVM will not exit while any non-daemon thread is alive. In particular, the pool that services futures and agent send-off calls uses an Executor cached thread pool with a 60 second timeout. In the scenario above, the program will wait until the background threads have completed their work and the threads expire before it can exit.</p>
</div>
<div id="write_skew" class="paragraph">
<p><strong><a href="faq#write_skew">Why the Clojure STM does not guarantee serializability but only snapshot isolation?</a></strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If reads were included by default, then STM would be slower (as more transactions would require serializability). However, in many cases, reads do not need to be included. Thus, users can choose to accept the performance penalty when it is necessary and get faster performance when it is not.</p>

<h2 id="_namespaces"><a class="anchor" href="#_namespaces"></a>Namespaces</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div id="ns_file" class="paragraph">
<p><strong><a href="faq#ns_file">Do namespaces map 1-to-1 with files?</a></strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>No (although that is typical). One namespace can be split across multiple files by using <code>load</code> to load secondary files and <code>in-ns</code> in those files to retain the namespace (clojure.core is defined in this way). Also, it is possible to declare multiple namespaces in a single file (although this is very unusual).</p>
</div>
<div id="ns_as_fn" class="paragraph">
<p><strong><a href="faq#ns_as_fn">Do namespaces work like regular functions? Looking at the syntax, it seems ns could be returning a function that makes a namespace, and then if you just stick parens around the contents of the file, that would be a regular S expression too. Does that imply you can put more than one in a file?</a></strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ns is a macro that does a number of things:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>creates a new internal Namespace object (if it does not yet exist)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>makes that namespace the new current namespace (<code>*ns*</code>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>auto-refers all vars from clojure.core and imports all classes from java.lang</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>requires/refers other namespaces and vars as specified</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(and other optional things)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ns does not return a function or anything invokable as you suggest.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While ns is typically placed at the top of a clj file, it is actually just a normal macro and can be invoked at the repl just the same. It could also be used more than once in a single file (although this would be surprising to most clj programmers and would likely not work as desired in AOT).</p>

<p><strong><a href="faq#direct_linking_repl">How does direct linking affect the REPL experience?</a></strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anything that has been direct linked will not see redefinitions to vars. For example, if you redefine something in clojure.core, other parts of core that use that var will not see the redefinition (however anything that you newly compile at the REPL will). In practice, this is not typically a problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For parts of your own app, you may wish to only enable direct linking when you build and deploy for production, rather than using it when you developing at the REPL. Or you may need to mark parts of your app with ^:redef if you want to always allow redefinition or ^:dynamic for dynamic vars.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Java 9 added a module system, allowing code to be partitioned into modules where code outside a module cannot invoke code inside the module unless it has been exported by the module. One of the areas affected by this change in Java is reflective access. Clojure uses reflection when it encounters a Java interop call without sufficient type information about the target object or the function arguments. For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint highlight"><code class="language-clojure" data-lang="clojure">(def fac (javax.xml.stream.XMLInputFactory/newInstance))

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here <code>fac</code> is an instance of <code>com.sun.xml.internal.stream.XMLInputFactoryImpl</code>, which is an extension of <code>javax.xml.stream.XMLInputFactory</code>. In the java.xml module, javax.xml.stream is an exported package, but the XMLInputFactoryImpl is an internal implementation of the public abstract class in that package. The invocation of <code>createXMLStreamReader</code> here will be reflective and the Reflector will attempt to invoke the method based on the implementation class, which is not accessible outside the module, yielding:</p>

<li>
<p>As of Clojure 1.10, turn off illegal access with <code>--illegal-access=deny</code>.

Clojure will find the public invocation path instead and no warning will be issued.</p>

<p><strong><a href="faq#encapsulation">How do you achieve encapsulation with Clojure?</a></strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because of its focus on immutable data, there is generally not a high value placed on data encapsulation. Because data is immutable, there is no need to worry about someone else modifying a value. Likewise, because Clojure data is designed to be manipulated directly, there is significant value in providing direct access to data, rather than wrapping it in APIs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All Clojure vars are globally available so again there is not much in the way of encapsulation of functions within namespaces. However, the ability to mark vars private (either using <code>defn-</code> for functions or <code>def</code> with <code>^:private</code> for values) is a convenience for a developer to indicate which parts of an API should be considered public for use vs part of the implementation.</p>

<p><strong><a href="faq#native">Will there be a native version of Clojure in the future?</a></strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Frequently people ask for a "native" version of Clojure, ie one that does not rely on the JVM. ClojureScript self-hosting is one current path but probably only useful for a subset of use cases. The [<a href="https://www.graalvm.org/" class="bare">https://www.graalvm.org/</a>](GraalVM) project includes standalone execution using the SubstrateVM. Native images produced with Graal start extremely fast but may have fewer opportunities to optimize performance than the full JVM.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, neither of these is likely what people are envisioning when they ask for a "native version of Clojure", which is a version of the language that is not JVM-hosted and compiles directly to a native executable, probably via something like LLVM. Clojure leverages an enormous amount of performance, portability, and functionality from the JVM and relies heavily on things like a world-class garbage collector. Building a "Clojure native" would require a large amount of work to make a version of Clojure that was slower (probably much slower), less portable, and with significantly less functionality (as the Clojure library relies heavily on the JDK). The Clojure core team has no plans to work on this but it would be an amazing learning project for anyone and we encourage you to go for it!</p>
